# GLDC-ICARDA
Agriculture plays a significant part in the economic development and the well-being of any country. The increased use of scientific tools and techniques in agriculture has led to an increase in the production of food, and therefore a decrease in poverty and malnutrition. This  platform can evaluate and dislpay different GLDC  agricultural strategies and technologies from differenct dry and developing countries and rank them based on their performance (Poverty change, Malnutrition change , BCR) using a multi-criteria decision analysis method (TOPSIS).  Determining the best agricultural solutions for every region will reduce the failure rate of upcoming agricultural projects which will help decreace poverty and malnutrition in that region.
